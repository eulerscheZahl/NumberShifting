      This is an offline optimization game. Unlike other optimization puzzles, this one has a correct solution. You will start with an introduction level. When solving the level, you will get another (harder) level. The goal is to solve as many levels as possible.

      You are given a grid, filled with numbers. You can move a number horizontally or vertically by exactly as many cells as the value of the number. The number has to be pushed on another number. The moved number will then be added to the other number or subtracted. The absolute value will be taken on subtraction. The goal is to clear the board and not have any numbers remaining.

      <div class="text">The program must output the level code first. The code of the first level is <const>first_level</const>.</div>
<br>
Then the level will be given as follows: <br>
Line 1: <var>width</var> <var>height</var>, the size of the level. <br>
Next <const>height</const> lines: <const>width</const> values <var>val</var> in the grid.
<br><br>
Then the program has to output the actions to solve the game, each in a new line:<br>
<command>x y dir +/-</command>, the position of the number that shall be moved, the direction (<var>U</var>,<var>D</var>,<var>R</var>,<var>L</var>) and a <var>+</var> to add the numbers or a <var>-</var> to subtract them.
<br><br>
When the solution was correct, the code to play the next level will be given in the game summary.
